# Keyword_Research_And_Analysis
This project involves using Google Keyword Planner to search for keywords relevant to a product called "AI VIDEO GENERATOR." Analysis was performed to show the level of relevance of the keyword based on search volume, competition (either low, medium, or high), and region (globally or to a specific country).  

1. The keywords were grouped into classes.
2. The search volume, growth, relevance, competition, and region were gathered.
3. The top keywords were gathered based on the ones with the highest search volume
4. Article names were created using the top keywords to get more traffic.
5. Competitive analysis was carried out on the keywords. 

Tools Used are:
- Google keyword planner
- Microsoft Excel/Google Sheet

NOTES: The criteria to be met for keyword selections are:
- Search volume must be greater than or equal to 100 (depending on your needs)
- You can choose a particular country or it can be a global search
- The Competition level must be between Low and Medium
- The relevance must be Medium to High
- There must be a steady growth increase (in percentage) of the keyword.
